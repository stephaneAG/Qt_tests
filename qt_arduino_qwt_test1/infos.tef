## PLOTTING RANDOMLY GENERATED DATA FROM ARDUINO COMING FROM SERIAL IN QT QWT ##
## USING A CLASS FOR THAT (..)

# to be able to compile & link against the 'qextserialport'lib as a shared library & also the 'qwt' lib, also as a shared library:

# 1: go to the directory we extracted 'qextserialport' in, then:
qmake
make
sudo make install

# 1bis: go to the directory we extracted 'qwt' in, then;
make
sudo make install

# 2: once the 'qextserialport' library has been correctly generated & installed, we need to add the following to the '.pro' file to link against the installed 'qextserialport' shared library
CONFIG += extserialport

# 2bis: similarly, we have to add the following to link against the installed 'qwt' shared library
CONFIG += qwt

# 3: then, to compile:
qmake
make

# 4: ultimately, to run:
./<appname>
