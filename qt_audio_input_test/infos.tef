# R: to compile correctly ( at least with Qt 4.8 on Ubuntu 13.04 ), we need to fix some of the Qt's team errors :/
# -> from the online tutorials, we can download the entire file, but we need to edit two of them: the "*.pro" file, & the generated "Makefile"
#
# Note: I personallychoosed to generate a clean "*.pro" file using the "qmake -project" command, & then edit it to fix the necessary ( as follows ). 
#
# Note2: The same approach is used for both the "audioinput" & the "audiooutput" examples ( & maybe also the 3rd example from the online tutorials -> got to test ( .. ) )

## - for the "*.pro" file - ##
# -> we add the following:
#
#  after: " INCLUDEPATH += . "
# we add: " INCLUDEPATH += /usr/include/QtMultimediaKit /usr/include/QtMobility "
#
#  after: " SOURCES += audiooutput.cpp main.cpp "
# we add: " QT      += multimedia "
#

## - for the "Makefile" file - ##
# -> we change the following:
#
#  change: " INCPATH       = -I/usr/share/qt4/mkspecs/linux-g++-64 -I. -I/usr/include/qt4/QtCore -I/usr/include/qt4/QtGui -I/usr/include/qt4/QtMultimedia ..."
#      to: " INCPATH       = -I/usr/share/qt4/mkspecs/linux-g++-64 -I. -I/usr/include/qt4/QtCore -I/usr/include/qt4/QtGui -I/usr/include/qt4/QtMultimediaKit ... "
#
#  & also: " LIBS          = $(SUBLIBS)  -L/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu -lQtMultimedia ... "
#      to: " LIBS          = $(SUBLIBS)  -L/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu -lQtMultimediaKit "
#


# After this, both programs sources should compile correctly
# -> ENjoy :p
